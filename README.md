## Hi, I'm Recep  
### Electronics & Software Engineer | Embedded Systems | IoT Product Development  

I've been into electronics since I can remember. I started by fixing small circuits and ended up designing full IoT systems with custom PCBs, firmware, and mobile apps.  
It’s been more than 15 years now — and I still get excited when I see an oscilloscope trace behaving exactly as I expected.

### What I Work On
Most of my projects are related to **energy monitoring**, **smart agriculture**, and **industrial IoT**.  
I enjoy the full process — from drawing the schematic and routing the board to writing the firmware and building the mobile app that controls it.  
I’ve worked with systems that use STM32, LoRa, NB-IoT, RS485, and Modbus communication, often combined with Flutter-based mobile interfaces.

Some of the projects I’m proud of:  
- **PowerStat** – a 3-phase energy monitoring system with mobile control  
- **WeatherStat** – LoRa-based weather station used in field environments  
- **FilterStat** – IoT filtration control device for agricultural systems  
- **UV Lens Tester** – small bench-top device that measures UV protection of eyeglass lenses  

Most of the design files are private due to company and client policies,  
but I can share block diagrams and architecture overviews if needed.

### What I’m Good At
- PCB design (KiCad, Altium)  
- STM32 & Atmel firmware development  
- LoRa / RS485 / NB-IoT communication  
- Flutter app integration for IoT dashboards  
- Power quality and 3-phase energy measurement  

I also enjoy debugging — both hardware and code —  
and I can spend hours chasing down a single floating pin or timing bug until it behaves.

### A Few Personal Notes
I’m currently based in Sweden and open for collaborations or freelance projects.  
I like reading about philosophy, religion, and psychology — probably because I’ve always been curious about how both systems *and* people work.  
Outside of work, I spend most of my time with my family and sometimes build things just for fun.

Thanks for stopping by!  
If you like hardware that actually works — we’ll probably get along.
